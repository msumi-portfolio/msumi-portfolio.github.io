// CSS hub to list/organize CSS files
// automatically generates into static site's styles.css, which is the stylesheet used by layouts
// import order matters, ex: put variables before they're called in the main

@import "main-variables";
@import "main"; // tell sass to look for a file called main.scss in /_sass
@import "main-responsive";
